# Stack Ocean – DevSecOps Pipeline

**Stack Ocean** is a Netflix Clone application built to demonstrate a **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** that integrates modern tools for automation, security, and monitoring. The project showcases how to build, test, secure, deploy, and monitor applications in a production-grade environment.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Application**: Netflix Clone (frontend & backend)
* **CI/CD**: Jenkins
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
* **Monitoring & Alerting**: Prometheus + Grafana
* **Security Scanning**: Trivy (container & dependency scanning)
* **Code Quality**: SonarQube

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Commit**

   * Using existing GitHub repository.

2. **CI with Jenkins**

   * Jenkins pipeline is triggered automatically.
   * Steps include:

     * Build application
     * Run unit tests
     * Perform **SonarQube analysis** (code quality & security)
     * Perform **Trivy scan** (image/dependency vulnerabilities)

3. **Containerization**

   * Docker builds application images.
   * Images are pushed to DockerHub or a private registry.

4. **Deployment with Kubernetes**

   * Jenkins deploys the images to a Kubernetes cluster using manifests/Helm.

5. **Monitoring & Alerts**

   * Prometheus scrapes metrics from the application and cluster.
   * Grafana visualizes metrics with custom dashboards.
   * Alerts are sent via Slack/Email for critical events.

## 📊 Key Features

* Automated **CI/CD pipeline** with Jenkins.
* **Container security scanning** with Trivy.
* **Code quality gates** enforced using SonarQube.
* **Scalable deployments** on Kubernetes.
* **Real-time monitoring and alerting** with Prometheus & Grafana.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add automated integration tests.
* Extend monitoring dashboards for user analytics.
* Enable deployments with Kubernetes.
